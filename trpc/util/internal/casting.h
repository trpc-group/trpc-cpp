/// @brief Inspired by `llvm/Support/Casting.h`.
/// @sa: https://www.llvm.org/docs/HowToSetUpLLVMStyleRTTI.html (design)
/// @sa: https://llvm.org/doxygen/Casting_8h.html (source code)
/// Our design deviates from std's in:
///   - `(dyn_)cast` does not accept `nullptr`, use `(dyn_)cast_or_null` instead.
///     (LLVM does this, which is good, since `nullptr` shouldn't appear in most cases.)
///   - In cases when conversion failure is fatal, `cast` should be used in place
///     of `dyn_cast`. We follow LLVM's design here to be more clear about the
///     semantics. (In std's convention, whether conversion failure is fatal
///     depends on "target type". That's a little vague IMO.)
///   - We follow LLVM's convention, in that `(dyn_)cast(_or_null)` accepts a
///     "normal" type (instead of a reference or pointer type) as its template
///     parameter. The keyword `dynamic_cast` accepts either `T*` or `T&`. This is,
///     to say the least, inconsistent with std's convention. However, the
///     inconsistency also exists in the Standard Library (@sa: `xxx_pointer_cast`,
///     which accept "normal" type, too), so we tolerate this inconsistency.
/// @note Usage:
/// We cannot magically tell if a given reference or pointer is of excepted
/// runtime type. It's your responsibility to provide such facility.
///
/// The contract is that for each type `T`, you must implement do one of the followings:
///   - If you always cast objects to their exact runtime type (not ever casting
///     them to some type they inherited from) when doing down-casting, you can
///     inherit your type from `ExactMatchCastable` and call `SetRuntimeType(this,
///     kRuntimeType<T>)` in constructor. (@sa: `ExactMatchCastable`.)
///     You can still use `dynamic_cast` or specialize `CastingTraits<T>` for
///     certain types to down-cast to their base classes in this case.
///   - Provide a static method of signature `bool T::classof(const U& val)` in
///     `T`, which returns `true` if `val` can be casted to `T` (i.e., `val`'s
///     runtime type is (or is a subclass) of `T`.). You can use `Castable` (@sa:
///     `Castable`) to simplify your work a bit.
///   - Specialize traits type `CastingTraits<T>`, which in turn, provides static
///     method doing the same thing as `T::classof`, with signature `bool
///     RuntimeTypeCheck(const U& val)`. Compared to providing `classof`, this
///     approach might seem to be more non-intrusive. However, this can be more
///     verbose, and in most cases, it's an overkill.
/// @note Implementation note:
///     `bool T::classof(const U& val)` tests if `val`'s runtime type is (or inherits
///     from) `T`, by whatever means you deem fit. We use this information is to
///     implement methods listed in this file correctly.
///
///   One way to do this is tagging each instance with its real type, e.g.:
///
///   ```
///   struct Base {
///     enum { kA, kB } type;
///
///     // For base class, there's no need to provide `classof(...)`. Casting
///     // from derived types to base is always allowed.
///   };
///
///   struct A : Base {
///     A() { type = kA; }
///
///     static bool classof(const Base& val) {
///       // `B` inherits from `A`. Consequently, every instance of `B` is also
///       // an instance of `A`. (@sa: `B`.)
///       return val.type == kA || val.type == kB;
///     }
///   };
///
///   struct B : A {  // Inherits from `A`.
///     B() { type = kB; }
///
///     static bool classof(const Base& val) { return val.type == kB; }
///   };
///   ```
