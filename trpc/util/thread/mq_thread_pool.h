/// @brief The implementation of task-steal thread pool
/// The difference between this class and `SQThreadPool` is:
/// this class there are two queues:
/// 1. shared task queue
/// 2. thread local queue
/// Tasks submitted by threads outside the thread pool are submitted to the shared queue,
/// and all threads in the thread pool can take tasks from it for execution.
/// The tasks produced in the threads in the thread pool are submitted to their own local private queues,
/// when other threads are idle, they can get tasks from the shared queue,
/// or steal tasks from the queues of other threads.
///
/// usage:
///
/// trpc::ThreadPoolOption thread_pool_option;
/// thread_pool_option.thread_num = 2;
/// trpc::MQThreadPool thread_pool(std::move(thread_pool_option));
/// thread_pool.Start();
/// thread_pool.PushTask([]());
/// thread_pool.Stop();
///
