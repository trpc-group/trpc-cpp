/// @brief The framework provides interfaces for obtaining various types of time.
/// 1. Obtain the precise time from Epoch or the system start-up time;
///    used in scenarios with high time precision requirements.
/// 2. Obtain the rough timestamp from Epoch using thread sampling; used in scenarios with high performance requirements
///    but low time precision requirements.
/// 3. Conversion between time strings and time.
/// The time interfaces include: milliseconds (ms), microseconds (us), and nanoseconds (ns); 1ms=1000us=1000000ns
/// Epoch: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z
