/// @brief The first step is to implement a time queue that stores the number of requests
/// @note We use a queue to represent a time window of 1s, and the number of queues N represents N time slots
/// Optimization 1: We suggest that the size of N be 2 ^ n-2, so that frequent redundancy operations can be replaced by AND operations. 
/// We have considered directly expanding the user's memory to 2 ^ n-2, but in reality, the expansion may take up a large amount of memory, so this is just a suggestion
/// Optimization 2: We add an atomic variable to represent the total number of smooth windows, which can save the need to calculate for loops every time (which involves concurrency control)
/// The queue itself uses atomic to represent some intra class elements, ensuring that the atomicity of individual variable modification operations is not strictly synchronized
/// But when calling the checkpoint() of this queue, a double loop is used to ensure that there will not be a moment when the threshold is exceeded

/// The second step of the plugin requires a timer to process the forward movement of the window at a scheduled time
/// The timer here needs to open a thread to do so, so it requires interfaces for creating, starting, and destroying threads

/// 1. Implement a circular queue using vector<uint64_t>of size N
/// 2. The size of the circular queue represents the number of time slots divided into 1s
/// 3. Each time slot corresponds to an integer element in the queue, storing the cumulative number of requests in that time slot
/// 4. The passage of time corresponds to the movement of the 'smooth window'
/// Every time the timer is triggered (once every 1/N second), the oldest time slot is removed and a new time slot is added (the count is reset to 0)
/// 5. The number of requests in the current time slot accumulates to the count of the latest time slot
/// 6. Accumulate the count within the current queue range when calculating the total number of requests within 1s
/// 7. The rotation of the time slot is achieved by calling the NextFrame() function through an external timer thread
