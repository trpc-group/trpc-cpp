/// @brief The rate limiting protection filter that used in conjunction with the backup request retry feature. It is
///        used to disable  retries when the request failure rate is too high, in order to avoid overloading the backend
///        service.
///        The algorithm is implemented using a token bucket mechanism:
///        1. The number of tokens in the bucket is initialized to max_tokens. When a request succeeds, the token count
///        is increased by 1 until it reaches max_tokens.
///        2. When a request fails, the token count is decreased by N (i.e. token_ratio) until it is less than 0.
///        3. The retry/hedging strategy only works normally when the number of tokens in the bucket is greater than
///        half of the capacity. When the number of tokens is less than or equal to half of the capacity, retries are
///        cancelled.
/// @note If either the original request or the retry request succeeds, it is considered a success. If both fail,
///       it is considered a failure.
